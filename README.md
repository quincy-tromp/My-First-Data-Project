<h1>My Finance DB Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Goal: Load my financial data into MySQL</h2>
<p>For this project I will create a data pipeline that loads my bank transactions into a database, to analyze this data in the future. 
I believe that more insight can help make better decisions. Normally I keep track of this in Google sheets, but I find this to be somewhat limiting. 
I think there's more value to be had out of this data. Also this is a passion project. So, why not?</p>
